JavaScript Math Operators

Math operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers.

Operator	   Description	            Example	Result
+	           Addition	                5 + 2	7
-	           Subtraction	            5 - 2	3
*	           Multiplication	        5 * 2	10
/	           Division	                5 / 2	2.5
%	           Modulus (Remainder)	    5 % 2	1
**	           Exponentiation (ES6)	    5 ** 2	25
++	           Increment	            let a = 5; a++	6
--	           Decrement	            let a = 5; a--	4

 
JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	Description	                     Example	Equivalent To
=	        Assignment	                     x = y	        x = y
+=	        Addition Assignment	             x += y	        x = x + y
-=	        Subtraction Assignment	         x -= y	        x = x - y
*=	        Multiplication Assignment	     x *= y	        x = x * y
/=	        Division Assignment	             x /= y	        x = x / y
%=	        Modulus Assignment	             x %= y	        x = x % y
**=	        Exponentiation Assignment (ES6)	 x **= y	    x = x ** y

JavaScript Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Operator	Description	        Example	        Result
&&	        Logical AND	        true && false	false
`		`	Logical OR
!	        Logical NOT	        !true	        false

These operators are fundamental in JavaScript and are used to perform various operations in programming. Understanding them is crucial for writing efficient and effective code.
