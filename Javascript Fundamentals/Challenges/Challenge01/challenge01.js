// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
// m tall.
// Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
// m tall.
// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜Š

const marksMass = 78;
const marksHeight = 1.69;
const johnsMass = 92;
const johnsHeight = 1.95;

const marksBMI = marksMass / marksHeight ** 2;
const johnsBMI = johnsMass / (johnsHeight * johnsHeight);
console.log(marksBMI, johnsBMI)
